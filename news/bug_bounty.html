<h1>New Bug bounty Program</h1>
<p>CoinHarbour recognizes the importance and value of security researchers efforts in helping keep our community safe and now offer a <i>Bug Bounty</i> program. Incentives are available for reporting bugs or security vunerabilites in the CoinHarbour platform.</p>

<h2>Responsible investigation and reporting</h2>
<ul>Responsible investigation and reporting includes, but isn't limited to, the following:
    <li>Do not violate the privacy of other members, destroy data, disrupt our services, etc.</li>
    <li>Only target your own accounts in the process of investigating the bug. Do not target, attempt to access, or otherwise disrupt the accounts of other members.</li>
    <li>Do not target our physical security measures, or attempt to use social engineering, spam, distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, etc.</li>
    <li>Initially report the bug only to us and not to anyone else.</li>
    <li>Give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the bug before disclosing it to anyone else, and give us adequate written warning before disclosing it to anyone else.</li>
    <li>In general, please investigate and report bugs in a way that makes a reasonable, good faith effort not to be disruptive or harmful to us or our members. Otherwise, your actions might be interpreted as an attack rather than an effort to be helpful.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, any bug that poses a significant vulnerability, either to the security of our site or the integrity of our trading system, could be eligible for a reward. It is entirely at our discretion to decide whether a bug is significant enough to be eligible for a reward.</p>
<ul>Eligible bugs include, but not limited to:
    <li>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</li>
    <li>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</li>
    <li>Code injection</li>
    <li>Remote code execution</li>
    <li>Privilege escalation</li>
    <li>Authentication bypass</li>
    <li>Clickjacking</li>
    <li>Leakage of sensitive data</li>
    <li>Low energy requirement less ETH issuance is required to incentivize participation</li>
</ul>

<p>Domains in scope: coinharbour.com.au, www.coinharbour.com.au, api.coinharbour.com.au.</p>

<p>We generally do not accept reports for doc.coinharbour.com.au unless a bug is critical as the site is isolated from all member data and authentication.</p>

<h2>Ineligibility</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, any bug that poses a significant vulnerability, either to the security of our site or the integrity of our trading system, could be eligible for a reward. It is entirely at our discretion to decide whether a bug is significant enough to be eligible for a reward.</p>
<ul>Things that are not eligible for reward include:
    <li>Vulnerabilities on sites hosted by third parties (support.coinharbour.com.au, etc.) unless they lead to a vulnerability on our main domains.</li>
    <li>Vulnerabilities contingent on physical attack, social engineering, spamming, DDOS attack, etc.</li>
    <li>Vulnerabilities affecting outdated or unpatched browsers.</li>
    <li>Vulnerabilities in third-party applications that make use of CoinHarbour's API.</li>
    <li>Bugs that have not been responsibly investigated and reported.</li>
    <li>Bugs already known to us, or already reported by someone else (reward goes to the first reporter).</li>
    <li>Issues that aren't reproducible.</li>
    <li>Issues that we can't reasonably be expected to do anything about.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reward</h2>
<p>The minimum reward for eligible bugs is the equivalent of AU$100 in bitcoin.</p>
<p>Rewards over the minimum are at our discretion, but we will pay significantly more for particularly serious issues.</p>

<p>Only one reward per bug.</p>

<h2>Severity levels</h2>
