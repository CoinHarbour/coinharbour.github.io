<h1>About CoinHarbour</h1>

We are working to make the cryptoeconomy – a more fair, accessible, efficient, and transparent financial system.

We started in 2020 with the idea that anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive cryptocurrency. Today, we offer a trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader cryptoeconomy.

Our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world
Everyone deserves access to financial services that can help empower them to create a better life for themselves and their families. If the world economy ran on a common set of standards that could not be manipulated by any company or country, the world would be a more fair and free place, and human progress would accelerate.

<h2>Our culture</h2>

<h2>Clear communication</h2>
We are direct and succinct. We share information efficiently, improving collaboration and productivity. We practice active listening.

<h2>Efficient execution</h2>
We have a bias for action. We complete high quality work quickly. We focus on the 20% of work that will get us 80% of the impact.

<h2>Act like an owner</h2>
We take 100% responsibility for achieving the mission. We seek to improve all aspects of our company even in ways that are not explicitly part of our job.

<h2>Continuous learning</h2>
We're humble, and value learning over being right. We embrace delivering and receiving candid feedback, and see every setback as an opportunity to learn.

<h2>Top talent</h2>
We take extraordinary measures to have exceptional people in every seat. We ask whether each candidate will raise the average on the team before making an offer. We cast a wide net, to attract candidates from every background, focusing on both skill and culture alignment. We actively coach and develop. Unremarkable performance gets a generous severance package.

<h2>Championship team</h2>
We are a winning team, not a family, and have high expectations for performance and delivering results. We're stronger together so we choose to focus on what unites us, and not on what divides us. We have an intense work culture, and are regularly pushed out of our comfort zones. We take rest seriously, to improve productivity over the long term. CoinHarbour should continually earn employees' commitment and, likewise, expects employees to earn their seat at the company.

<h2>Customer focus</h2>
We are deeply focused on solving our customers' problems with technology, by enabling them to acquire, store and use crypto. We strive to be the easiest to use, most trusted and most secure platform. In every decision we make, we ask, "How does this create more value for our customers?"

<h2>Repeatable innovation</h2>
We are builders, leveraging technology to improve the world, constantly shipping ideas vs. just discussing them. We know that companies must continually reinvent themselves to avoid stagnation. We have a high tolerance for failure, investing 10% of our resources in venture bets that are uncomfortably ambitious.

<h2>Positive energy</h2>
We are optimistic about the future and determined to get there. We co-create solutions instead of choosing blame and criticism. We create moments of play at work.

<h2>Mission first</h2>
‍Our mission is ambitious and important. We don’t engage in social or political activism that is unrelated to our mission while at work. We seek to make the workplace a refuge from division, so we can stay focused on making progress toward the mission.
