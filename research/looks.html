    <h1>Looksrare Token (LOOKS)</h1>
    <p>LOOKS is the token powering LooksRare, the community-focused NFT marketplace that actively rewards traders and creators for participating.</p>

    <p>100% of LooksRare's platform trading fees are earned by LOOKS token stakers: a rewards model created in direct response to the previous generation of NFT marketplaces whose fees mostly reward a single entity. Users earn LOOKS tokens by trading NFTs on LooksRare, staking LOOKS (which also earns WETH fees).</p>

    <p>LooksRare's trading experience is intuitive for experienced NFT traders, while also providing new and innovative features like collection-wide offers, instant royalty payouts for creators, and flexible purchases using mixed tokens (WETH +ETH).</p>

    <p>Behind the simple user experience lies an innovative, modular smart contract design and a full-stack built from the ground up for scalability, security, and speed.</p>

    <p>LooksRare's model was designed in direct response to the previous generation of NFT marketplaces, with the goal of fostering the NFT community by rewarding user participation.</p>
