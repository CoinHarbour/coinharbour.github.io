  <h1>Template Coin (TEMP)</h1>
    <p><b>Template Coin (TEMP)</b> is a 2016 founded Australian peer-to-peer energy trading company. It uses a blockchain-based cryptocurrency and energy trading platform that allows for decentralized selling and buying of renewable energy. The platform provides consumers with access to a variety of energy markets around the globe and is meant to be scalable to various energy infrastructures and regulations. The market is based on a dual-token ecosystem operating on two blockchain layers, POWR and Sparkz. POWR tokens allow consumers and hosts providing energy to interface with the ecosystem and are protected through Smart Bond technology. POWR tokens can be converted into Sparkz tokens, which can be used for frictionless transactions in the energy exchange market. The initial coin offering for POWR tokens became the largest crowd funding project in Australia and the 14th highest in the world.</p>

    <b>History</b>
    <p>Plans for a blockchain energy trading platform based in Perth, Australia were publicly announced on 11 August 2016 by chair Jemma Green and managing director Dave Martin. On 24 August the company announced that it would utilize Ecochain technology to store energy readings. Power Ledger's white paper was officially released in a company press release on 27 July 2017. In the white paper[2], the company revealed an ERC-20 Ethereum-based token called POWR, which would be implemented into the Power Ledger platform, and Sparkz, on their own Consortium Ethereum Network. The company maintained that demand for POWR tokens would increase as the platform user-base grows, thereby changing the price of the token and allowing for the exchange of POWR tokens for Sparkz tokens.</p>

    <p>In January 2020 Power Ledger purchased a 250 kilowatt photovoltaic system that will utilize a blockchain-based data management and settlement system.</p>

    <b>Criticism</b>
    <p>In December 2018, the company was criticized for paying spruikers.[8] Power Ledger later responded, stating 'The article contains a number of inaccuracies we believe require clarification'.</p>
